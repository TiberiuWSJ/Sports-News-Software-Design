# Sports News Application

As a Software Design project, I'm implementing a capable online news website, focused on sports, like 🥊 MMA, 🏎️ Formula 1, ⚽ Soccer or 🏀 basketball.


## Features

- User can sign up to be able to save certain stories, get notified by newsletter, share or like their favourite news.
- Journalists should be signed up by the site moderator, and he's able to add stories to the website.
- A capable search bar that anyone can use to find stories by title.
- Stories can be saved by tags, besides title, body and image, that describe the sport, the sportsman, and what's happened (#LewisHamilton, #ConorMcGregor, #JoshuaVSFury).
- The User can pick a favourite team, or sportsman to follow, and he can have a certain section in his GUI where only news from that topic are shown. 


## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Java] - for the backend implementation
- [SpringBoot] - framework for the project
- [MySQL] - database handling
